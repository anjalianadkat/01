# Blockchain-basics

During my internship as a Software Developer, I learnt about the building blocks of Blockchain technology. Blockchain, as the name suggests, is made up of blocks containing information connected to each other forming a chain. A block is called node and each node is linked to its previous node by means of a Hash. A hash is a function that encrypts a message into a fixed length outout. This repo includes pieces of code for understanding the mechanism behind Blockchain. 

1) Encryption of user details (name and password) using Cipher function

Front-end: Userdetails.html
Back-end: final1.jsp
Database: MySQL


2) Simple Blockchain 

Here's an instance of how blockchain looks like in the back-end. This blockchain includes blocks of information about the Sender, Receiver and transaction amount details, hashed using SHA-256 and stored into Mongo database. Secure Hashable algorithm (SHA-256) is a hashing algorithm that generates a 256-bit hash which is very difficult to decode without the key. 

Coded in NodeJS and MongoDB.
